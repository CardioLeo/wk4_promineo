**string literals, ` <<< backtics to call back variables, easier to read

let firstName = "frank";
let lastName = "stepanski";
console.log(`is amzing!!!`);



**const greeting = function(name) {
	return "hello $(name)!"
}

console.log(greeting(name)); //like this?

template literals
arrow functions
callbacks
promises (to be discussed another time)

var, global or function scope. a variable declared outside of a function becomes a global variable.

let, code block {} scoped. this is how most programming languages work with the only difference that variables are hoisted to the top of the code block

const, same scope as let, but value cannot be changed after set

const AZ_SALES_TAX = 0.056;
AZ_SALES_TAX = 0; //Error
